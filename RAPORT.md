## Project: “Pooled linkage analysis for discovery of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functional mutations by whole genome sequencing”

SRA:SRP003355, Whole Genome Sequencing
Experiments: 3 (3 samples)
Runs: 3 (3.8Gbp; 2.5Gb)
Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Layout: PAIRED
The purpose of this experiment was to identify mutated genes in vac6 and vac22 yeast mutants. 

# Pipeline:
1. Downloading reference genome (RefSeq GCF_000146045.2) and annotation using https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/ site. 
2. Downloading 1000000 reads SRA:SRP003355
